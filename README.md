# 📝 Product Feedback App.

## 📌 Description

A full-stack application for collecting and managing user feedback. I built it app as part of my school requirements to practice my full-stack development skills, creating a complete application from front to back showcasing the subjects taught over the previous 6 months. The goal was to build a polished, real-world application based on a professional design.

In this app users can submit new feature suggestions or bug reports. The app includes a filtering system to view feedback by category and a dynamic roadmap section that visually tracks the status of suggestions.

## ✨ Features

- **Feedback System:** Add feedback suggestions to the page for developer to encourage a better functioning app.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter suggestions by category (e.g., UI, UX, Bug, Feature).
- **Suggestions Counter:** View a summary of feedback organized by its total.
- **Form Validations:** Ensures data integrity with client-side validation on feedback submission form.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **No Feedback Page:** Allows the client to view when there isn't a feedback in the specific category and have the option to add one.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

List of tools and technologies used to build the frontend, backend and database.

### Frontend

- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS .
- **Framework:** React.
- **Deployment:** Netlify.

### Server/API

- **Languages:** JavaScript (Node.js).
- **Framework:** Express.js.
- **Deployment:** Render.

### Database

- **Languages:** PostgreSQL.
- **Deployment:** Neon.

## 💭 Reflections

### What did I learn?

I learned how to structure a full-stack application with a clear separation of concerns between the client and the server. This was a fantastic experience for handling complex application state like filters, sorting, and asynchronous data fetching.

### What am I proud of?

I'm particularly proud of achieving an almost pixel-perfect implementation of the figma design. The application feels smooth and responsive, especially the interactive elements like commenting. Building a complete, end-to-end feature—from a user clicking "Add Feedback" on the frontend to the data being validated and stored via the API in the database—was incredibly rewarding.

### What was challenging?

The most challenging aspect was managing the application's complex state. Ensuring that the UI updated correctly and efficiently after a user action (like adding a comment, or changing a filter) required careful planning. Another challenge was deploying the frontend and backend to separate services (Netlify and Render) and correctly configuring environment variables to allow them to communicate.

### Future ideas for further building the project:

- 🏆 Upvote product suggestions
- 🏆 Add a hamburger menu in mobile view
- 🏆 Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- 🏆 Edit an existing suggestion
- 🏆 Delete an existing suggestion
- 🏆 Add comments to an existing suggestion
- 🏆 Implement multi-filtering

## 🙌 Credits

This project was built as a solution to the Product feedback app assignment from AnnieCannons. The instruction model provided the design, assets, and user stories, which allowed me to focus solely on the technical implementation.

I'd especially like to thank my Backend Instructor Arianna for the empowerment I have received from her concerted efforts at educating me and my cohorts.
